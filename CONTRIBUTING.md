# Contributer's Guide

We welcome contributions from the community and have gathered guidelines here to help you get started.

# Discussion

While not absolutely required, it is encouraged that you first open an issue for any bug or feature request. This allows discussion on the proper course of action to take before coding begins.

# Building

```
yarn build
```

# Running the tests

```
yarn test
```

Or in watch mode:

```
yarn test --watch
```

These commands should work if you use npm as well.

# Changing

Most of the information you need to contribute code changes can [be found here](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/). In short: fork, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
